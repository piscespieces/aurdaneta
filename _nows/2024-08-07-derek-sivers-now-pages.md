After six years I decided to move from Miami to San Antonio, TX. I'm still getting used to the new place, dealing with self-doubt at moments but enjoying the change for real.

After couple years working as a software engineer in a fast paced startup, I realized the 8 to 6 job is not for me. Actually, the whole point learning how to code was to customize my guitar teaching lessons website at the time.

Now, I'm working on my projects. As [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/) would say: My utopia. [my software agency LPV.DEV](https://lpv.dev) and <i><strong>WynstonAI</strong></i> â€” my AI startup in a very much seed stage.
