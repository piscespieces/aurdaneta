People here seem surprised, curious, and somewhat pleased when I tell them that I come from Miami. Who’d imagine that the jungle, for some, is a paradise?

For me, San Antonio is a paradise for two main reasons:

- Lower cost of living
- Fewer people

After living long enough in an overpopulated and overpriced city, I know these two reasons go a long way.

Facing winter might be a challenge. I’m not sure how I’ll react to it, but it can’t be that bad. I’ve survived worse…

> On November 28, 2018, we drove my '06 Mazda 3 Hatchback from the Florida Keys to Atlanta. However, we never made it to ATL and ended up in New York instead, facing sub-30-degree Fahrenheit weather without a job, money, or even a single coat.
 
Locals complain about San Antonio’s traffic, and it is bad indeed. But it isn’t as bad as Miami’s traffic, so I feel I’ve won something there as well.

There’s also Austin’s proximity—just one hour and thirty minutes away from San Antonio.

*Ka-Ching!*🛎️ I get access to a major tech hub. That’s a no-brainer.

Even though I haven’t been to Austin yet, I feel optimistic about the city. I’ve read about its vibe and tech scene, which seem much more alive than Miami’s. So, I’m attending [Trends In Tech @ Capital Factory](https://www.capitalfactory.com/event/trends-in-tech-2024-08-22/) today and feel excited about the experience.

But is there a problem with moving from a large city to a smaller, lower-cost town like San Antonio? So far, the problem is from within.

The problem is the fear that comes after leaving your job security and comfort to move to unknown territories—the fear of living on the edge without knowing what’s about to happen, the anxiety, and the self-doubt.

The ever-present question: “Am I going to make it in this city?”
