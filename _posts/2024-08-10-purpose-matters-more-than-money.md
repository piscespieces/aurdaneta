I wanted a business to create my utopia, my world — somewhere I could live up to my high ideals and then, make money… But I got lost along the way.

I wanted a mission that would push my creative juices, give me plenty of time flexibility, and make me more money than I needed.

I wanted to be a music producer with a recording studio. That’s what success meant to me.

But there’s very little you can actually plan in life because life just happens.

And it certainly happened to me — [and over nine million Venezuelans](https://www.csis.org/analysis/persistence-venezuelan-migrant-and-refugee-crisis) — when I moved to the US as a refugee, fleeing the Venezuelan narco-communist government. Then, those dreams of “making it big in the music industry” were shattered.

As an immigrant, I ended up working in many soul-sucking labor jobs.

- Demolition labor in the Florida Keys when [Hurricane Irma destroyed South Florida](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLK6z0PMVF4).
- Dishwasher in a restaurant I can’t remember in Atlanta.
- [“Finichero”](https://chatgpt.com/share/50aec5ca-7148-4385-84ce-4439ba82530c) helper traveling across the US while living in my car.

And many others.

Tired of it, I stumbled upon web development and taught myself HTML, CSS and JavaScript to build websites for my friends and make a little side income.

Fast forward, and after much trial and error, I landed a job at a small web agency that paid me more money than I’d ever seen or needed. For the first time, I wasn’t broke, so I started using that money to buy experiences — a new car, audio gear, travel, toys — and funded some silly experiments.

I enjoyed it a lot. But I got very distracted from what mattered.

Now, as I’ve entered my thirties, I’ve started thinking more about _my purpose._

Having more money than you need is extremely cool, but it wears off, just like a new car, an expensive pair of sneakers, or dining at fancy restaurants… And it wears off quickly.

Without a _purpose_, you’re just heading toward unfulfillment and unhappiness.

#### But what is “purpose”?

I stumbled upon the book [_So Good They Can’t Ignore You_ by Carl Newport](https://www.amazon.com/Good-They-Cant-Ignore-You/dp/1455509124), which I didn’t actually read, but I skimmed a few sections and watched a YouTube review. From that, I took away this definition:

> Purpose is an intersection between being creative, being helpful, and developing mastery.

**Being helpful** was the most significant missing piece I’d never considered in my utopia.

All this time, I’d only considered the benefits I wanted: _time and money_. This is fine until it becomes greed, and greed can only take you so far.

> Greed is the opposite of gratitude.

So, I made a hard U-turn in my life.

I quit my fancy “Software Engineer” LinkedIn professional headline at [Haku](https://hakusports.com/) and moved to San Antonio, TX — a city undergoing a lot of development and growth, strategically located one hour from Austin, a major tech hub — to work full-time on my web development and web design agency [LPV.DEV](https://piscespieces.github.io/lbp/).

I’m attending meetups and events in the San Antonio and Austin areas, and I can’t help but feel bullish about the entrepreneurial scene and spirit here.

I’ve met people from different walks of life, with wildly different perspectives, niches I didn’t even know existed, and at various stages of their entrepreneurial journeys:

Newcomers looking to learn the ropes of running a business
Early-stage startups gathering feedback on their MVPs
People seeking their first seed round of funding
Startups looking to expand
Today, I am grateful to be part of this thriving creative ecosystem and look forward to using the skills I’ve acquired over the years to be as **helpful** and **resourceful** as possible.

More than ever, I want others’ utopias to become real; I want people with _purpose_ to succeed.
